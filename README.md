# Image Classification Network Based on ConvNeXt, ECANet, and GhostNet Fusion

Project Description: Designed and implemented a lightweight image classification network fused with ConvNeXt, ECANet, and GhostNet. This fusion architecture enhances the model's representational capability while maintaining high efficiency. Validated on the CIFAR-100 dataset, the fused model achieved an accuracy of 79.45%—outperforming the baseline models of ConvNeXt, ECANet, and GhostNet—with nearly 50% fewer parameters and only a 1.24% drop in precision.
